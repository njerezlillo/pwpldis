This package provides tools for fitting the piecewise discrete power-law model, a flexible statistical framework for modeling data that exhibits power-law behavior in different segments. It is applicable to fields such as complex networks, empirical distributions, and heavy-tailed phenomena. The package includes:

- Base Functions: Implementation of various functions related to the model, such as density, survival, hazard, random number generation, and more.
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation: A method for estimating model parameters, including change points and scaling parameters.
- Bootstrap Bias Correction: A resampling procedure for correcting estimation bias and quantifying uncertainty.

```

## Example

This section provides a concise example demonstrating how to use the main functions of the package:

We begin by generating a dataset 1,000 observations using the `rpwpldis` function from the discrete piecewise power-law model with specified parameters and change points. In this example, `p` represents the change points that define distinct power-law segments within the distribution, while `alpha` refers to the corresponding scaling parameters of each segment.

``` r
library(pwpldis)

p <- c(1, 10)
alpha <- c(1.5, 3.5)
df <- rpwpldis(1000, p, alpha)
```

We estimate the discrete piecewise power-law model for the dataset `df` previously generated using the `fit_pwpldis` function. The argument `nbreak = 1` indicates that the model should be fitted with a single change point. This function returns the estimated location of the change point along with the corresponding scaling parameters.

``` r
fit_1 <- fit_pwpldis(df, nbreak = 1)
```

In this step, we apply a bootstrap procedure using the estimated change point from `fit_1$tau_1` with two main objectives: 

- Creating bias-corrected versions of the maximum likelihood estimators.
- Constructing bootstrap confidence intervals for the model parameters.

``` r
boot_1 <- boot_pwpldis(df, brks = fit_1$tau_1)
```

First, we compute the bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimators using the following equation (see Ferrari and Cribari-Neto, 1998 for details):

$$
\hat{\alpha}_{j}^{\text{(boot)}} = 2\hat{\alpha}_{j} - \frac{1}{B} \sum_{i=1}^{B} \hat{\alpha}_{j}^{(i)}, \quad j=1,\ldots, k+1,
$$

where $\hat{\alpha}_{j}$ is the estimate from the original data, and $\hat{\alpha}^{(i)}$ denotes the estimated scaling parameter for each bootstrap sample, with $i=1, \ldots, B$, where $B$ is set to 100 by default in the `boot_pwpldis` function.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
2 * fit_1[, 3:4] - apply(boot_1[, 3:4], 2, mean)
```

Second, we compute the 95% confidence intervals for the scaling parameters of the piecewise model using the empirical quantiles of the bootstrap distribution. Specifically, we compute the interval $\left[ \hat{\alpha}{\gamma/2}^{*}, \hat{\alpha}{1-\gamma/2}^{*} \right]$, where $\hat{\alpha}_{\gamma/2}^{*}$ and $\hat{\alpha}_{1-\gamma/2}^{*}$ are the $\gamma/2$-th and $(1 - \gamma/2)$-th percentiles of the bootstrap distribution, respectively.

``` r
apply(boot_2[, 3:4], 2, function(x) quantile(x, c(0.025, 0.975)))
```

Finally, we plot the empirical cumulative distribution function of the simulated dataset to visually assess how well the data follows the cumulative distribution function of the fitted model.

``` r 
plot(ecdf(df), cex = 0.5, main = "Empirical vs. Fitted CDF", xlab = "x", ylab = "CDF")
cdf <- Vectorize(function(x) ppwpldis(x, c(1, 10), c(1.48, 3.49)))
points(unique(df), cdf(unique(df)), col = "red", cex = 0.5)
legend("bottomright", legend = c("Empirical", "Fitted"), col = c("black", "red"), pch = c(1, 1))
```
